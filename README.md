## 🤖 What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standard for tool providers to communicate with AI clients via standard input/output. This server lets you plug Bitcoin data tools into any MCP-compatible client.

## ⚡ Quick Start: Use in Your MCP Client

You can configure this server as a tool provider in your MCP Client client preference such Claude, Cursor, VsCode and others:

```json
"mempool-mcp-server": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "@sanlim/mempool-mcp-server"
  ]
},
```

> [!TIP]
> To connect locally for privacy and unlimited calls, you can pass the base mempool API URL as an environment config from your local Bitcoin node such as Umbrel, MyNode, etc. See below:
> ```json
>"mempool-mcp-server-local": {
>  "command": "npx",
>  "args": [
>    "@sanlim/mempool-mcp-server"
>  ],
>  "env": {
>    "MEMPOOL_BASE_URL": "http://umbrel.local:3006/api"
>  }
>},
>```
> Check this working with "mempool url" text on your MCP Client.

## 🤖 What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standard for tool providers to communicate with AI clients via standard input/output. This server lets you plug Bitcoin data tools into any MCP-compatible client.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start: Use in Your MCP Client

You can configure this server as a tool provider in your MCP-compatible client in two ways:

### 📦 Using the Published NPM Package

```json
"mempool-mcp-server": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "@sanlim/mempool-mcp-server"
  ]
},
```

To connect locally for privacy and unlimited calls, you can pass the base mempool API URL as an environment config from your local Bitcoin node such as Umbrel, MyNode, etc. See below:

```json
"mempool-mcp-server-local": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "@sanlim/mempool-mcp-server"
  ],
  "env": {
    "MEMPOOL_BASE_URL": "http://umbrel.local:3006/api"
  }
},
```

Enjoy!

or

### 🛠️ Using a Local Build

1. **Clone this repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexandresanlim/mempool-mcp-server.git
```

2. **Install and build:**

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run server
```

3. **Configure your MCP client:**

```json
"mempool-mcp-server-debug": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": [
    "/Users/aleguest/Desktop/workspace/mempool-mcp-server/build/main.js"
  ]
},
```

The server will start and listen for MCP requests via standard input/output. 🎉
